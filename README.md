workspace
=========

A new IDE concept based on web technologies with a focus on
extensibility and user experience.

The editor main features are:

- Easy to install and configure. Runs locally or remotely.
- Client/Server based. Client handles rendering, while server handles the heavy tasks.
- An open plugin API. Plugins can be enabled by project or by workspace.
- Intelligent Text Editor (based on CodeMirror) and Code Assistant including inline completion.
- A minimalistic yet powerful UI.
- A VIM mode plugin.

Plugins

You can also manually load it using the "plugins"
property of workspace.json.

In order to use the plugin you must load it by adding it to the workspace, see example above,
or by using the project.json file:
	
	{
		"plugins": [ "plugin name", "plugin2" ]
	}
